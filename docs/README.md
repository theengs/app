::: tip Note
The Theengs app reads data that is 'broadcasted' by devices, operating primarily in a passive mode without direct connections, except for Mi Flora and ThermoBeacon, where historical data is accessed through a connection. For all other devices, the app captures data as it is emitted by the sensors.

BBQ Live monitoring and notifications require the app to be active on the sensor screen.
